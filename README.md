### Maintainers

The packages git follows the archlinux svn structure.
It contains both core and extra PKGBUILD

Each package folder consists of a trunk and repos directory
The package will always be updated in trunk, and then based on trunk action taken in the repos directory.

$ buildtree -h
Usage: buildtree [options]
    -p <pkg>      Package name
    -s            Clone or pull repos
    -i            Import from arch packages
    -j            Import from arch community

To sync(clone or pull) the arch and artix git repos, run

    buildtree -s

To compare arch and artix repo versions, run

    buildtree -c

It will show a version comparison table between arch repos and artix repos.
The first repository column shows the archlinux repos the package is in.

To import package 'foo' from arch packages into artix foo/trunk, run

    buildtree -p foo -i

To import package 'foo' from arch community into artix foo2/trunk, run

    buildtree -p foo2 -j

In order to manage packages in the git tree, commitpkg standardizes the actions with descriptive commit messages.

release package 'foo2' from trunk into repos/staging-any and push

    stagingpkg -p foo2 -s trunk -u

move packages 'foo2' from repos/staging-any to repos/testing-any and push

    testingpkg -p foo2 -s staging -u

release package 'foo3' from trunk to repos/community-x86_64 and push

release package 'foo4' from trunk to repos/multilib-testing-x86_64 and push

    multilib-testingpkg -p foo4 -s trunk -u

move packages 'foo4' from repos/multilib-testing-x86_64 to repos/multilib-x86_64 and push

    multilibpkg -p foo4 -s multilib-testing -u


##### The jenkins pipeline will not trigger any action on the server, if only trunk has been modified, commited and pushed.

* Jenkinsfile stages
    * Checkout
    * Build
    * Add
    * Remove

* Any repo moving operation of a package in git will trigger Add and Remove stages.
* Any new repos subdirectory will trigger the Build stage.

### Contributors

If you want a new or updated package merged into the git repository, please send a Pull Request with only the trunk of a given package. Do not send PRs containing repos/$repo folders.
